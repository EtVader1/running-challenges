<h3>Translations</h3>
<p>
The following table indicates the current state of the translations that are
available for this extension. There are serveral parts that need to be
translated for it to be useful to parkrunners all over the world.
</p>
<p>
The volunteer roles appear to be displayed on the parkrun website in the language of the
site you are registered on, which means that although most are in English, there
are many other languages including French, German, Polish, and Russian.
</p>
<p>
If you are able to provide a missing translation for a volunteer role,
please email us and include a link to an athlete who has volunteered for that role
in the past (and check that it is listed in that language on their athlete history page) -
this will allow us to test the translations work when we add them in
</p>
