Say hello to the improved parkrun explorer map!

## The parkrun explorer map?

Yes. You might remember this as being the map for the regionnaire challenge, but we've rebranded it and 
added some more goodies for those people who generally want to plan their touristing and want to 
visualise where they have run on a map. It now lives below the stats table, and before the challenge tables.

### What's new?

We have computer what is called a "[voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram)" - we 
have divided the world into cells - the idea being that if you are within a particular cell, you know where the 
nearest parkrun to that location is. A picure is worth a thousand words, so here's an example:

![Running Challenges in the Chrome Web Store]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/voronoi-1.png "Running challenges voronoi diagram of the South coast of England"){: .center-image .image-border}

A green cell shows that you have done the parkrun for that area. The green is semi-transparent so that
you can see the features on the map behind.

The circles representing the parkruns are green for ones you have done, and black for the others.

As you zoom in the markers change in size, and eventually there is enough space on the map to draw the parkrun
event names - zoom right in if you want to find out which event you are looking at.

![Running Challenges in the Chrome Web Store]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/voronoi-2.png "Zoomed in Running challenges voronoi diagram around Cheshire"){: .center-image .image-border}

We found that having over a thousand markers on the map showing every parkrun didn't scale - and drawing the data
in this way appears to be quite efficient. It is hopefully easy for you to see which parkruns you have done, 
and which ones you haven't, without having lots of overlapping markers on the map.

### Do we have regions yet?

Why not create your own region! Hopefully by colouring the cells in this way it should be easy to tell if you 
been to all the events in a particular area of the country / world - just look for the continguous green 
parts of the map!

### Can I play Blockbusters across the country with it?

Yes. We think that would be an excellent idea. 

I'll have a P please Bob - cue everyone heading off to [Penistone parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/penistone/) :)

## Updated Japanese and Polish translations

When we added support for [parkrun.jp](https://www.parkrun.jp/) no events had been run yet, and we didn't know any
of the volunteer translations! Now, thanks to [William Steffancin (A4782624)](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteeventresultshistory/?athleteNumber=4782624&eventNumber=0) we have examples translations for most of the roles in Japan.

Meanwhile, in Poland, parkrun HQ updated most (all?) of the volunteer roles names, probably to be more technically
correct. Many thanks to [@sebuish](https://github.com/sebiush) who has provided us with an updated list. The purple 
badges should be showing correctly for Poland once more.

## How do I get all of this great stuff?

If you have already installed the extension it should update soon - typically we
have found it takes a few days for Chrome and Firefox to auto-update, but it should
do so eventually.  If you haven't yet joined the fun you can get it from one of
the links below. :
