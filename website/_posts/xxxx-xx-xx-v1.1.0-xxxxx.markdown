## Timezone fix for USA parkrunners

If you are a parkrunner in the USA, you might have noticed that some of your stats are a bit off or inconsistent (e.g. parkruns this year or most parkruns in a year), you've apparently run 14 times in Decembers when you can count only 11, you've been incorrectly awarded a Christmas Day badge when you've never run on Christmas Day, or your first parkrun is reported as having happened on a Friday. Something was clearly a bit off, but we've finally fixed it.

Thanks hugely to Tim Freer, not only for reporting this problem way back last year, but also for then investigating the code and sending us a full explanation of what he'd found and how to fix it.



## How do I get all of this great stuff?

If you have already installed the extension it should update soon. Typically we
have found it takes a few days for Chrome and Firefox to auto-update, but it should
do so eventually.  If you haven't yet joined the fun you can get it from one of
the links below. :
