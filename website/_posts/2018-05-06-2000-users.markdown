Wow, we've now got 2000 users!

In just under 2 months we've gone from nothing, to over 2000 parkrunners with
the Chrome extension installed. To be honest we have been overwhelmed by the
way the community have taken it to heart, and to hear it being referred to in
casual conversation on Facebook and Twitter makes it feel like it has just
become part of parkrun!

When we found parkrun founder Paul Sinton-Hewitt had liked our announcement post
on Facebook we were chuffed, but to see parkrun COO Tom Williams and Xempo
casually discussing who might have achieved the most Groundhog Days - that
really made us smile.

Stats are core part of parkrun; whether it be for knowing how many runs you have
completed, age-graded scores, or average finishing times, and tracking the uptake
of this extension is no exception :)

We don't add any analytics to the extension itself, so we don't know how many people
have added a home parkrun, where those parkruns might be, or how many badges we
had displayed for people - but the Google Webstore does show many installs/uninstalls
of the extension have occurred, and therefore how many active installs there are.
